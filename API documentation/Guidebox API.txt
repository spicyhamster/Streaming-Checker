Introduction
Welcome to the Guidebox API! Our API is organized around REST principles, with predictable, resource-oriented URIs, and uses sensible HTTP codes to indicate API errors. We use HTTP verbs and HTTP authentication, which every HTTP client should understand. We also support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to securely interact with Guidebox from your web applications.

Our API returns JSON for all responses, including errors.

Base API URL
From this base URL, you will structure your API calls.

Our API is available in JSON. The base URL is structured like this:

We highly recommend that you use our API Client Libraries for your chosen language, if one is available.

GET http://api-public.guidebox.com/v2/{endpoint}
Authentication
Each user is given an API key. In order to make a request to the Guidebox API, simply append the API key to the end of your request.

Alternately, you may pass in the API Key as an Authorization header.

$ curl http://api-public.guidebox.com/v2/genres?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY?api_key={YOUR API KEY}
As a Header

Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY
Setting a Region
By default, all API calls will be processed in the US region.


Using Other Regions
If you would like to use another region, you may pass it in as a query parameter or as a header

For a list of acceptable regions, please see the Regions endpoint.

As a query parameter:

GET /v2/{endpoint}?region=JP
As a header:

Guidebox-Region: JP
Using our Client Libraries

$ curl http://api-public.guidebox.com/v2/genres?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY?api_key={YOUR API KEY}&region=JP
API Limits
Rate limits are in effect for all users. All users may make up to 240 API requests per minute. For each request, additional response headers are passed to let you know where you stand:

Number of requests per minute

X-RateLimit-Limit: 240
As you hit the API, you will see the X-RateLimit-Remaining number decrease until it hits 0. You will receive an error when you run out of API calls for the current time window. When you hit that error, you will receive an additional header:

Number of requests remaining for this minute window

X-RateLimit-Remaining: 135
After the Retry-After header reachers 0, the minute window will reset and the X-RateLimit-Remaining header will reset as well, allowing you to once again successfully access the API.

Returns seconds remaining until next allowed request

Retry-After: 36
Quotas
Each API key is allowed to make a limited number of requests per month. If you need to make more requests, please contact Guidebox.

Headers
Each API response will return a header that contains your max requests per billing period, as well as the progress toward that quota.

Header
Guidebox-Quota:3995
Guidebox-Quota-Max:150000
API Endpoint
Alternately, you may use our API Endpoint to retrieve your current quota details.

API Endpoint
GET /v2/quota
Example Request
$ curl http://api-public.guidebox.com/v2/quota?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY

Episodes, Clips, and Segments

What are "Episodes"?
Episodes are full length videos associated with a particular show. Episodes are grouped into seasons and ordered by episode number.

What are "Clips"?
Clips (a.k.a. "Videos" or "Extras") are uncategorized videos associated with a particular show. Clips can be small snippets of an episode, behind the scene footage, or in some cases (as with YouTube and other online original shows) can be a self-contained piece of content which hasn't been assigned any episode level metadata.

What are "Segments"?
Segments are best explained using a cartoon as an example. Sometimes an episode of a cartoon is actually comprised of two or more complete cartoons with separate titles and storylines. These separate cartoons in the Guidebox ecosystem, when released individually on a playback source, are called episode segments. We treat episode segments differently then episodes or clips because episode segments are self-contained pieces of content (i.e. not a brief snippet or clip) and aren't a full episode because the full episode in the original broadcast (or release) of the cartoon included two or more other episode segments.
